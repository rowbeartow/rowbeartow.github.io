                <p class="favorite-book">My favorite book is <em cite="https://www.amazon.com/Confederacy-Dunces-John-Kennedy-Toole/dp/0802130208">A Confederacy of Dunces</em> by John Kennedy Toole. Its central character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is an educated but slothful 30-year-old man living with his mother in the Uptown neighborhood of early-1960s New Orleans who, in his quest for employment, has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confederacy-Dunces-John-Kennedy-Toole/dp/0802130208"><em>A Confederacy of Dunces</em></a> is a great read because the many subplots are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor.</p>

                            <p><em>I've never met a pizza I didn't like, and now my wife and I have started making our own pizza from scratch. I like to grow vegetables, and choose what I grow based on what makes the best pizza toppings / ingredients. This summer I made salsa from my garden that was the best pizza topping OF ALL TIME!!!</em></p>
                        
                        <li><big><strong>BACON</strong></big></li>

                            <p><em>I've flirted with being a vegetarian my whole life, but the one food I could never give up is bacon. The smell of bacon does something to my brain that makes me lose all self-control. I'm the guy that orders a veggie burger with bacon on it.</em></p>
                        
                        <li><big><strong>SUSHI</strong></big></li><br>

                            <p><em>I grew up eating salmon, and always thought I hated fish until my wife's family introduced me to sushi. From the moment I tried my first crunchy roll, I have not been able to eat enough sushi. I went from being weirded out by eating raw fish to fully Zoidberg'ing sushi every chance I get. Now have to convince myself that gas station sushi is probably not the best idea.</em></p>
